# UNMSM-MATHEMATICAL-METHODS-FOR-PHYSICISTS

The course Mathematical Methods for Physicists provides a rigorous foundation in the essential mathematical tools and techniques used across theoretical and applied physics. Its objective is to develop both conceptual understanding and practical skills in handling the complex mathematical structures that arise in physical theories. The course is structured into four key units:

Unit I: Linear Spaces and Tensor Analysis
This unit introduces vector spaces, linear transformations, and tensor algebra—core concepts for formulating physical laws in both classical and relativistic contexts. Particular emphasis is placed on abstract vector spaces, basis transformations, and the manipulation of tensorial quantities.

Unit II: Functions of a Complex Variable
Complex analysis plays a central role in many areas of physics, especially in quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and fluid dynamics. This unit explores analytic functions, Cauchy’s theorem, Laurent series, residue calculus, and conformal mapping, equipping students with tools to solve integrals and model physical systems.

Unit III: Ordinary Differential Equations, Special Functions, and Partial Differential Equations
Differential equations are the language of physics. This unit covers methods for solving ordinary differential equations and introduces special functions such as Bessel, Legendre, and Hermite functions. It then extends to techniques for solving partial differential equations relevant to heat conduction, wave propagation, and quantum systems.

Unit IV: Green's Functions and Distributions
The final unit focuses on advanced techniques for solving inhomogeneous differential equations, including the use of Green’s functions. It also introduces the theory of distributions (generalized functions), which provides a robust mathematical framework for dealing with singularities and discontinuous phenomena in physics.

Throughout the course, the emphasis will be on developing mathematical intuition and applying these methods to real problems in physics. By the end, students will be equipped to approach advanced theoretical topics with greater confidence and precision.
